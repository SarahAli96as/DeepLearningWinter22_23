**Your answer:**

used references: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant - explanation of Jaccobian Calclations.


1.A. Given in_features = 1024, out_features = 512, and the layer is fully connected laye
 --> W shape is = 512 X 1024; also the shape of X is 64x1024
the shape of the Jacobian is: 64 x 1024 x 64 x 512

1.B. yes, element-ij in the jaccobian J_Yij depends only on row xi as we are deferentiating Y w.r.t on X;
therfore when calculating the derivations , when i != j -> J_Yji = 0, so for sure teh Jacobian is sparse¬ß

1.C. No, we can calculate the downstream gratdient w.r.t. to the input X using 
the given  gradient of the output w.r.t. some downstream scalar loss  ùêø ,  ùõøùíÄ=‚àÇùêø‚àÇùíÄ multiplyin by matrix W.


2.A. Shpae of W is 512x1024 and Y is 64x512, thurfore the shape of Jacobian is 64 x 1024 x 64 x 512
((((A.I Majd )))) please  review this
2.B. yes, it is sparsed with the same explanantion but in here w.r.t to wi instead of xi.

2.C. No, with the same explanation but n calculation using X instead of W.

A.I Majd - please review the answer
Reference to be removed: https://www.quora.com/Is-Deep-Learning-possible-without-back-propagation

No, it is not required.
The back-propagation computes the gradient of the loss function 
with respect to the weights of the network for a single input‚Äìoutput,as part of the optimization procedure,
it was proved by researchers that it is so efficient. but it is not required, a different algorithm can be
used to calculate the gradients for the loss function with respect to the model parameters,
such as alternate algorithms that implement the chain rule
